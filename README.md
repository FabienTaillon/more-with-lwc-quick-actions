# More with LWC Quick Actions

This repo contains the sample code for the Interchange episode More with LWC Quick Actions.

## How Do You Create a Scratch Org ?

You'll need to connect to your DevHub, running `sfdx auth:web:login`.  
If you're not familiar with SFDX and how to setup it, I recommend doing [this Trailhead module](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/fr/content/learn/modules/sfdx_app_dev).

In addition to the [SFDX CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) you may need [Texe√Ø's SFDX Plugin](https://github.com/texei/texei-sfdx-plugin), install it running `sfdx plugins:install texei-sfdx-plugin`.

Then just run the `setupScratchOrg.sh` script in this repo, or manually run the actions it contains.  

Have fun!
